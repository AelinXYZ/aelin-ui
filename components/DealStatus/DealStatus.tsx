// DEAL OPEN (during the pro rata or redemption period phases)
// CLOSED (when either a deal has been submitted and is no longer redeemable or when a deal is never found and the duration passes)

// data needed to show proper status
// 1. Pool Open - before teh purchase expiry timestamp {x}
// 2. Seeking Deal - if the duration period is active and deal has not been presented yet { }
// 3. Funding Deal - whether a deal is in the holder funding period { }
// 4. Deal Open - when a deal is in pro rata or open period
// 5. Closed - if the duration period is passed and deal has not been presented or when deal is no longer redeemable

// how to know if deal has been presented? and then from there are we in the funding period or has that been completed and we are in a purchasing phase
